# Zity

A first person zombie survival game. Wander the ever foggier streets of a randomly generated city-scape maze and try to avoid the zombies!

Written over a couple of weeks for a game hack event. Recently rediscovered and slightly refactored, but let's admit, the code is a mess :')

## Getting Started

1. Clone the git project and `cd` into the base directory.

1. Install dependencies with `npm install`.

1. To start the server, run the command:
    ```console
    npm start
    ```

1. Open http://localhost:6001 and play :)
