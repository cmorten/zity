# Zity

A first person zombie survival game. Wander the ever foggier streets of a randomly generated city-scape maze and try to avoid the zombies!

Written over a couple of weeks for a game hack event.

# Usage

1. Clone the git project and `cd` into the base directory.

2. To start the server, run the command:
    ```
    npm start
    ```
3. Open http://localhost:6001 and play :)

Note: it says there are two game modes... there aren't, and it never really got finished in terms of point scoring, leaderboards etc. functionally works otherwise.
